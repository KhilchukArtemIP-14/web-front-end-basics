        <div class="text-right"> <div class="right-txt-container">Once upon a time in the land of Fluffernutter, a group of talking marshmallows decided to start a competitive rollerblading league. They believed that the key to world peace was to see who could do the most impressive triple axel while balancing a pineapple on their heads. As they zipped around the cotton candy streets, the clouds above rained down Skittles, which they collected in their rainbow-colored skates to power their secret time-traveling toaster oven. Legend had it that the toast it produced could decode the language of squirrels and translate it into Shakespearean sonnets, thus solving the age-old acorn shortage crisis. And so, the marshmallows rollerbladed on, in pursuit of pineapple-topped balance and squirrel-inspired sonnets, convinced that their sugary dreams held the key to a brighter, more nonsensical world.</div>

      <div class="bot-txt"><div class="bot-txt-container">In the mystical realm of Jellipopia, a society of sentient rubber ducks embarked on an ambitious quest to build a pyramid made entirely of bubblegum. Their grand plan was to create the world's first-ever bubble-powered rocket ship. They believed that once their chewy monument reached the stars, it would communicate with extraterrestrial gummy bears and establish intergalactic diplomacy through interpretive dance battles. To gather the necessary bubblegum, they organized an annual "Great Bubblegum Harvest" where they sang opera to coax gumdrops from gumdrop trees and engaged in intense debates with talking lollipops about the nature of nougat. The rubber ducks were certain that their sugary space odyssey would usher in a new era of candy-coated cosmic cooperation, and they quacked with enthusiasm as they stuck another piece of bubblegum to their ever-growing pyramid.</div>
